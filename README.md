### Render the book


- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.


- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)

### Edit README

Once you've completed these steps, delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project with a link to the book URL. It would be appreciated if you add the following to the end:

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*

(And starring the repo would be nice too so I can see if this is getting used or not!)
